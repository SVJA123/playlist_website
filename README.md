# Playlist-Web

## Description
This program features a playlist app where users can store multiple playlists each consisting of their own list of music. Users can view their list of playlists as well as add, edit or remove them as they like. Playlists will also have their own descriptions which users can edit as they like in the edit playlist section. The user can then click on view music which appears for every playlist to view the music within the chosen playlist. Each music object will display their name, artist, album, genre and the year they were released. Additionally, the music object will also have a section that links to a spotify website of chosen music. The users can also add, edit and remove music from their playlist just like the playlist. <br /><br />
The second feature of this program is the search feature. Users can go to the search section and write a song title or playlist that they want to find. There are three buttons with each being search music, search playlist and search all. A search music will not display a playlist that contains the search word, and vice versa for search playlist. A search all would display both music and playlists which contain the search word. Both music and playlist will have a link that will redirect the user to the playlist which they are in.
